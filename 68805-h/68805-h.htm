</div>

<p>The Raker Bill, named for John E. Raker of Modoc
county, Cal., a member of Congress, was reported unanimously by
the House Committee on the Public Lands at the special session
of Congress in the summer of 1913, after a hearing occupying
several days, and under its recommendation passed the House.
This bill was reported favorably by the Senate Committee on
the Public Lands, and, after a hard fought contest, occupying a
week on the floor of the Senate, passed that body December 6th,
1913, by a vote of 43 to 25. It received the approval of President
Wilson and became a law on December 19, 1913.</p>

<p>The enactment of this bill ended a continuous effort on the
part of San Francisco, covering a period of many years, to obtain
the legal right to take water from Hetch-Hetchy. It marked
the end of a contest, spirited and hard fought, which was participated
in by the magazines and press the country over, and
in which the great majority of publications outside of California
opposed the plan of San Francisco.</p>

<p>As this legislation affords legal opportunity for a water
project primarily for domestic use, which is in itself a signal and
notable work of engineering; as it affects vitally and strongly the
irrigation interests of a state having a length of about 775 miles
and a land surface greater than the combined areas of the six
New England States, of New York, New Jersey, Delaware and
Ohio—a State which James Bryce characterized as an empire
within itself; as it gives a State a very important easement, likely
to be enduring, in a national park sharing alone with the great
Yellowstone National Park in distinctiveness and notoriety; as it
is designed to provide the legal means of furnishing water and
much power for the next 100 years for a rapidly growing metropolitan
section, now more numerously peopled than any other
west of Chicago, the Raker Bill and its accessories are of national
interest.</p>

<p>For the foregoing reasons inquiry is made:</p>

<p>First—What is Hetch-Hetchy, and what, if any, are the
present holdings and interests of San Francisco in the Yosemite
National Park?</p>

<p>Second—What is the Raker Bill?</p>

<p>Third—What will be the operative effects of the Raker Bill
on San Francisco and the rest of California outside the Yosemite
National Park?</p>

<p>Fourth—What will be the operative effects of the Raker
Bill on the Yosemite National Park?</p>

<h3>I. What is Hetch-Hetchy, and what, if any are the present holdings
and interests of San Francisco in the Yosemite
National Park?</h3>

<p>(1) Until the agitation connected with obtaining water for
San Francisco brought in the name of Hetch-Hetchy, the writer
supposed Hetch-Hetchy to be probably the name of some
Indian chief, some new brand of cigars or some noted trotting
horse. Possibly some of those who read this article are still
nearly as ignorant as was the writer then.</p>

<p>Hetch-Hetchy is the name of a valley through which flows
the Tuolumne River, and has tributary to it a watershed comprising
459 square miles. It lies entirely in Tuolumne County, California,
entirely in the Yosemite National Park, of which it is the
northern portion, and about 165 miles from San Francisco.</p>

<p>The Yosemite National Park contains about 1500 square
miles. Hetch-Hetchy Valley is separated from the Yosemite
Valley by a mountain range having a mean elevation of over 8500
feet, and distant from that valley about thirty-five miles by mountain
trail. The floor of the valley is between 3000 and 4000 feet
in altitude, is level and grass covered, and two or three miles
long and nearly half a mile wide. It is surrounded by steep
cliffs, out of which extend deep gorges. Just back of Hetch-Hetchy
is a gorge a mile deep and one and a half miles wide.
The sides of the valley are granite and very steep and precipitous,
rising to a height of between 2000 and 5000 feet in
different places. The valley is divided into two parts by a large
ridge of rocks extending nearly across the middle. The upper
end of it is a high, dry area, covered with tall pine trees, varying
between 200 and 300 feet high, and with live oak and other
kinds of trees, thus forming a natural park. The grasses, shrubs,
flowers and trees are beautiful. Several distinguished naturalists
have pronounced the natural growth as very unusual. There
are a greater variety of trees and larger oaks in the Hetch-Hetchy
Valley than in the Yosemite.</p>

<p>The area tributary to Hetch-Hetchy is very rough. Edmund
A. Whitman, a lawyer of Boston and president of the Society
for the Protection of National Parks; who has several times
visited Hetch-Hetchy, in his testimony before the House Committee
on the Public Lands last summer, stated:</p>

<p>“I cannot attempt to describe to you the character of the
country. It is some of the roughest God ever made. You do
not find little places here and there with grass and water, but the
largest part of the country is the roughest sort, where camping
is as impossible as it would be on the top of this table.
Camping and the use of the park reduces itself to one thing—the
feed of horses. There are only three places in the entire
park where you can take care of horses.”</p>

<p>Hetch-Hetchy Valley is difficult of access. Because of the
high, rough country surrounding it but few people visit it.
Thus while 6000 or 7000 people visit the Yosemite Valley each
year, less than 300 visit Hetch-Hetchy Valley. The valley, difficult
to reach in summer, is rendered almost inaccessible as soon
as the early snows begin to fall, and in winter is enshrouded
in four or five feet of snow.</p>

<p>The summer season in that high altitude is short, and rendered
shorter than the ordinary in Hetch-Hetchy by the cooling
effect of the mountain streams, almost icy cold, and by the surrounding
mountain peaks, snow-capped except for a small part
of the year.</p>

<p>The Tuolumne River rises on the eastern side of California
among the highest crests of the Sierras and for five or six miles
flows through a meadow, but during the next twenty miles drops
3000 feet, in which distance some of the falls in the river
are beautiful and picturesque. Next it flows for about two miles
through Hetch-Hetchy Valley, then becomes a rushing mountain
torrent for twenty miles more, and finally empties into the San
Joaquin River in Stanislaus County, almost directly east of the
southern end of San Francisco Bay.</p>

<p>Lake Eleanor and Cherry Valley are northwest of Hetch-Hetchy.
Lake Eleanor, distant about eight miles, is approximately
1000 feet higher than Hetch-Hetchy. Cherry Valley is
distant about twelve miles and is approximately 1000 feet higher
than Eleanor. Cherry Valley has tributary to it 114 square
miles of territory, all in the Stanislaus National Park. Lake
Eleanor and the seventy-nine square miles tributary to it are
entirely in the Yosemite National Park. The outlets of Cherry
Valley and of Lake Eleanor empty into the Tuolumne River
several miles nearer the San Joaquin than Hetch-Hetchy.</p>

<p>(2) A report of the State Geologist of California in 1879 suggested
Hetch-Hetchy Valley and Lake Eleanor as possible sources
of water supply for the city of San Francisco.</p>

<p>In 1883 a corporation was formed to supply water to San
Francisco from the sources of the Tuolumne River. Filings
were made and considerable work put in. In 1901 the City Engineer
was directed to examine the available sources of water
supply for San Francisco. He investigated fourteen different
sources and under suggestion of the reclamation service spent
about $50,000 in detailed investigation of the sources of the
Tuolumne, with a view to utilization at Hetch-Hetchy and
Lake Eleanor. That was before the section was taken into the
Yosemite National Park in 1905.</p>

<p>The city engineer made his report in 1901 when James D.
Phelan was Mayor. This report was immediately approved by
the Board of Public Works and since then has been the settled
municipal policy of San Francisco so far as water is concerned.
This report recommended the Tuolumne River in the following
words:</p>

<p>“This source presents the following unrivalled advantages:
Absolute purity by reason of the unhabitable character of the
entire watershed tributary to the reservoirs and largely within
a forest reservation. Abundance far beyond possible future
demands for all purposes. Largest and most numerous sites for
storage; freedom from complication of water rights; power possibilities
outside the reservation.</p>

<p>“It has the drawback of distance to overcome, requiring the
constructing of conduits aggregating 142 miles in length. But
considering the partial and rapid rate of pollution to which all
other sources may in the future be subjected, particularly nearby
sources, the Tuolumne River is far superior to any other.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, Mayor Phelan posted notices on the banks of
the Tuolumne on July 29, 1901, of his claim to 10,000 miner’s
inches of the waters of that river, “for irrigation, manufacturing
purposes, water power and domestic use.” Phelan, when his
rights matured, assigned them to the city, as the law did not allow
a municipality to make a filing.</p>

<p>Under a grant issued May 11, 1908, by James R. Garfield,
Secretary of the Interior, San Francisco obtained permission
to store the waters of Lake Eleanor and Cherry Valley, develop
them to their highest capacity, and when they should prove insufficient
for the needs of the city, to store water in the Hetch-Hetchy
Valley by crossing it with a dam. Secretary Garfield
conditioned in this grant that San Francisco should submit the
proposition to the people of the city for ratification, should
buy up all the land held by private owners around Hetch-Hetchy
and Lake Eleanor and hold such land for the city.</p>

<p>This proposition was voted upon by the legal voters of San
Francisco in November, 1909, in a resolution as to whether or not
they wished to acquire a means of water supply in the sources of
the Tuolumne River, according to the terms of the Garfield permit,
and to vote a municipal bond issue of $600,000 to obtain the
land and water rights necessary therefor. The proposition
was carried by a vote of more than five to one.</p>

<p>Thereupon San Francisco paid $174,311.20 for 720 acres
of privately owned land in the Hetch-Hetchy Valley and for
certain other lands so held which were not on the floor of the
valley, but which, under the permit, the city must buy for camp
sites, so that when campers were excluded from the floor of the
valley they still might have a place to camp. These 720 acres
comprise about two-thirds of the floor of Hetch-Hetchy Valley.
They are now held by San Francisco in fee simple title. Next
the city bought standing timber from the Government around
Lake Eleanor for $13,428.77. Then out of the $600,000 voted,
the city bought the land and water rights claimed by private
owners around Lake Eleanor for $400,000.</p>

<p>In January, 1910, under the suggestion of Secretary of the
Interior Ballinger, the proposition to obtain water for the city
from the sources of Tuolumne and to authorize the issuance of
bonds in the amount of $45,000,000 was submitted to the legal
voters of San Francisco. Some 30,000 votes were cast and only
about 1200 votes were in opposition.</p>

<p>The city supposed it had bought all available water rights
of Lake Eleanor and Cherry Valley. That the city had not soon
developed, and it expended $600,000 more to control these rights.
The expense of investigations around the sources of the Tuolumne
has been $300,000 or $400,000. Hence, upon the project San
Francisco has already paid out in excess of $1,500,000, probably
nearly $1,700,000.</p>

<p>Of the $174,000 spent on lands in Hetch-Hetchy, $81,306.18
were spent for 720 acres. For the exchange lands $92,457.02
were expended. 640 acres outside the valley proper were
bought for camp sites under the order of the Secretary of the
Interior. At Lake Eleanor private persons owned nearly all the
dam sites. Now San Francisco owns about one-half and the
United States Government about one-half. Here the development
will be very expensive.</p>

<p>At Cherry Valley almost everything is owned by San Francisco.
Owners of property around Cherry Valley and Lake
Eleanor received $1,000,000 for property which cost them approximately
$100,000. The area in the irrigation districts below
the dam sites is mostly included in the Turlock-Modesto district.
In the vicinity of Hetch-Hetchy Valley the city owns 1040 acres
and around Lake Eleanor, all in the National Park, 920.33 acres
more, making a total inside the park of 1960.33 acres. In Cherry
Creek the city owns 860 acres below Hetch-Hetchy, in Hog
Ranch 322.45 acres, and in Ike Dye Ranch 163.68 acres, making
a total of 3406.46 acres.</p>

<p>Secretary Ballinger, in 1909, requested the matter be taken
up de novo. At the direction of President Taft a board of
three army officers was assigned by the Chief of Engineers to
investigate and report on the subject of water supply for San
Francisco as bearing particularly upon the need of the sources
of the Tuolumne for San Francisco. This board of engineers was
appointed in 1911 and consisted of Colonel John Biddle, Colonel
Spencer Cosby and Colonel Harry Taylor. It occupied two
years in a thorough investigation of all available sources of water
supply for San Francisco and made a complete, detailed report,
February 19, 1913. This board testified at length before the Committee
on the Public Lands of the House of Representatives in its
hearings on the Raker Bill. The statements of its chairman, Colonel
John Biddle, formed the most exhaustive, detailed and apparently
accurate testimony there given upon the available water
supplies for San Francisco.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Interior Fisher, successor of Secretary
Ballinger, wished the subject investigated as an absolutely new
proposition. John R. Freeman of Providence, R. I., perhaps the
ablest engineer in the country upon water supplies, was engaged
and spent much time in California upon the subject at a cost of
about $300,000. Two years were occupied by these investigations,
entirely independent of the work of the board of army engineers.
The result of the research of Engineer John R. Freeman was a
comprehensive report recommending that this source is preferable
to all others, and that the Hetch-Hetchy Valley be developed
first and Lake Eleanor Valley and Cherry Creek be made
secondary and accessory to Hetch-Hetchy. In November, 1913,
Secretary Fisher came to San Francisco and held a hearing lasting
ten days, when the entire matter was presented. Within a
week of the retirement of Secretary Fisher from the Cabinet with
the going out of President Taft, the Secretary recommended that
some action be taken on the part of Congress, as the acts of 1901
to 1905, together with the Garfield permit, were somewhat indefinite
and the precise authority of the Secretary of the Interior
therein questionable. Hence the Raker Bill.</p>

<h3>II. What is the Raker Bill?</h3>

<p>This bill is entitled “A bill granting to the city and county
of San Francisco certain rights of way in, over and through certain
public lands, the Yosemite National Park and Stanislaus
National Forest, and the public lands in the State of California,
and for other purposes.” It is in eleven sections.</p>

<p>The bill grants to the city and county of San Francisco
necessary rights of way through the public lands of the United
States to Hetch-Hetchy Valley, Lake Eleanor and Cherry Valley
for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining aqueducts
“for conveying water for domestic purposes and uses to
the city and county of San Francisco, and such other municipalities
and water districts as, with the consent of the city and county
of San Francisco, or in accordance with the laws of the State
of California in force at the time application is made, may hereafter
participate in the beneficial use of the rights and privileges
of this act,” and “for the purpose of constructing, operating and
maintaining power and electric plants, poles and lines for generation,
sale and distribution of electric energy; also for the
purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining telephone
and telegraph lines.”</p>

<p>The whole construction and maintenance is under such conditions
and regulations as may be fixed by the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture within their respective
jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Section 7 is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That for and in consideration of the grant by the United
States as provided for in this act, the said grantee shall be required
to assign free of cost to the United States all roads and
trails built under the provisions hereof; and, further, after the
expiration of five years from the passage of this act the grantee
shall be required to pay to the United States the sum of $15,000
annually for a period of ten years, beginning with the expiration
of the five-year period before mentioned, and for the remainder
of the term of the grant, shall, unless otherwise provided by
Congress, pay the sum of $30,000 annually, said sums to be paid
on the 1st day of July of each year. Said sums shall be kept
in a separate fund by the United States, to be applied to the
building and maintenance of roads and trails and other improvements
in the Yosemite National Park and other national parks
in the State of California. The Secretary of the Interior shall
designate the uses to be made of sums paid under the provisions
of this section, under the conditions specified herein.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sanitary regulations are strict under this bill. No offal
or refuse can be placed “in the waters of any reservoir or stream
or within 300 feet thereof within the watershed above and
around said reservoir sites.”</p>

<p>A filtration plant may be installed at the discretion of the
grantee.</p>

now constituted under the laws of the State of California, or
as said districts may be hereafter enlarged to contain in the aggregate
not to exceed 300,000 acres of land to receive 2350 second
feet of the natural daily flow of the Tuolumne River,
measured at the La Grange dam, whenever the same can be
beneficially used by said irrigation districts; and that the grantee
shall never interfere with said rights.”</p>
</div>

<p>The last of section 9 provides:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That at such time as the aggregate daily natural flow of the
watershed of the Tuolumne and its tributaries, measured at the
La Grange dam shall be less than said districts can beneficially
use and less than 2350 second feet, then and in that event the
said grantee shall release, free of charge, the entire natural
daily flow of the streams which it has under this grant intercepted.”</p>
</div>

<p>Proviso is also made that if the lower irrigation districts
desire more than the usual amount they may have it up to a
certain quantity by paying a rate fixed by the Secretary of the
Interior.</p>

<p>Under section 9 other provisions are:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the said grantee shall not divert beyond the limits of
the San Joaquin Valley any more of the waters from the Tuolumne
watershed than, together with the waters which it now
has or may hereafter acquire, shall be necessary for its beneficial
use for domestic and other municipal purposes.</p>

<p>“That when the said grantee begins the development of the
Hetch-Hetchy reservoir site it shall undertake and vigorously
prosecute to completion a dam at least 200 feet high, with a foundation
capable of supporting said dam when built to its greatest
economic and safe height.</p>

<p>“That the said grantee shall upon request sell or supply to
said irrigation districts and also to the municipalities within
either or both said irrigation districts, for the use of any land
owner or owners therein for pumping subsurface water for
drainage or irrigation, or for the actual municipal public purposes
of said municipalities (which purposes shall not include sale to
private persons or corporations), any excess of electrical energy
which may be generated and which may be so beneficially used
by said irrigation districts or municipalities.</p>

<p>“That the right of said grantee in the Tuolumne water supply
to develop electric power for either municipal or commercial
use is to be made conditional upon its installing, operating and
maintaining apparatus capable of developing and transmitting,
under a general increase in amount, not less than 60,000 horse-power
at the end of twenty years. The said grantee shall develop
and use hydro-electric power for the use of its people and shall
at prices to be fixed under the laws of California, or, in the
absence of such laws, at prices approved by the Secretary of the
Interior, sell or supply such power for irrigation, pumping or
other beneficial use.”</p>
</div>

<p>The bill further provides that after twenty years the Secretary
of the Interior may require the grantee to develop, transmit
and use or offer for sale such additional power less than 60,000
horse-power as the grantee may have failed to develop, transmit,
use or sell within the twenty years. In case of the failure of the
grantee to carry out these requirements, the Secretary of the
Interior is authorized to provide for the development, transmission,
use and sale of such power and power not developed or
used. For that purpose the Secretary “may take possession of
and lease to such person or persons as he may designate” such
portion of the property of the grantee as may be necessary for
the purpose in view.</p>

<p>The bill also provides that the grantee shall build certain
roads and trails in and near Hetch-Hetchy Valley.</p>

<h3>III. What will be the operative effects of the Raker Bill on San
Francisco and the rest of California, outside the Yosemite
National Park?</h3>

<p>(1) The situation of San Francisco at the end of a long
peninsula is not one favorable naturally for an abundance of water
for a city of nearly half a million. During the golden days of
’49 the water supply came from a stream within the limits of
the city. This stream is now in the Presidio and consequently
is the property of the United States. Next Lobos Creek water
was carried along the shores of the Golden Gate in a wooden
flume and through a tunnel, then pumped to high reservoirs, from
which it flowed through the city.</p>

<p>As the city grew, the Spring Valley Water Company came
into existence and furnished water for the city from a storage
reservoir on Pilarcitos Creek, about twenty-five miles from the
city. This company has gradually developed its system and about
twenty years ago in Alameda county, on the east side of the Bay,
began to obtain water from a large area of gravel beds. This
water was taken into a reservoir, thence through aqueducts and
submarine pipes into San Francisco. San Francisco is now consuming
about 50,000,000 gallons of water per day. Of this amount
over 8,000,000 gallons come from private wells in different parts
of the peninsula. The Spring Valley Water Company furnishes
about 41,500,000 gallons, of which about 17,000,000 gallons come
from San Mateo County.</p>

<p>City Engineer M. M. O’Shaughnessy of San Francisco testified
before the House Committee on the Public Lands in Washington,
June, 1913 that this city now needs 75,000,000 gallons of
water per day and that about one-third of the city is without
water and obliged to haul it in barrels and wagons. Development
of the city has been considerably retarded through lack of water.
Engineer O’Shaughnessy stated before the committee “for the
past three or four months I have been making explorations all
over the city in our narrow peninsula, trying to develop what
strata there are that will be capable in an emergency of relieving
our situation.”</p>

<p>The Spring Valley Water Company is endeavoring to relieve
the stress of the situation by starting the construction of
the so-called Calaveras dam in Calaveras Valley. But the supply
of water behind this is uncertain. The company has built galleries
seven or eight feet deep in the gravel beds, into which the
water percolates.</p>

<p>After the disaster of 1906 San Francisco bonded itself for
$6,000,000 and thereby constructed a high pressure auxiliary water
system, operating about seventy-two miles of pipe. A reservoir
was built at an elevation of 600 feet, filled through a pumping
station drawing salt water from the bay. Another pumping station
is now under construction at Fort Mason.</p>

<p>The city expects to buy the Spring Valley Water Company
by condemnation in case purchase cannot be effected otherwise.
Since the passage of the Raker Bill condemnation proceedings
have been begun.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The territory on both sides of the Bay, extending south</span><br />
to San Jose for about fifty miles, has a common interest in
obtaining water. All of its people look to San Francisco to
take the lead. A population of about 1,000,000 is included
here, of which Alameda furnishes about 25,000, Oakland about
200,000, Berkeley about 50,000 and Richmond about 15,000.
Under the law passed four years ago, known as the “metropolitan
district act,” two or more municipalities are allowed to join together
in a water supply association. Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda
and some other towns on the Bay have joined to condemn the
local water supply to include Lake Chabot. But in these towns
the situation is even worse than in San Francisco. The eyes of
the people are turned anxiously to that city in the hope that before
long she may obtain such an abundance as to fill out their
lack and to provide for the future of these rapidly growing cities.

<p>The proposition of San Francisco is to build a dam across
Hetch-Hetchy Valley 100 feet at the bottom, 760 feet at the top
and 300 feet high. This will cover 1930 acres of land with
water and extend the water back between seven and eight miles
and one and one-half miles wide at the widest point. It is also
proposed to build a dam 150 feet high and 1500 feet long at
Lake Eleanor. This will flood 1443 acres. The Hetch-Hetchy
dam and reservoir will supply in dry seasons 250 gallons a day
per capita for 1,000,000 people. Colonel John Biddle of the
Board of Army Engineers estimated the cost of the Hetch-Hetchy
supply at $77,000,000.</p>

<p>The final development will give to the command of San
Francisco between 400 and 500 million gallons a day. The dams
will be of massive masonry. The water will be carried through
cement-lined steel pressure pipes and concrete lined tunnels ten
feet in diameter, cut through the mountains of the coast range.
There will be about eighty-three miles of water tunnels. Under
the formation of water districts this water can be divided between
the two sides of the Bay and approximately 1,000,000
people can now use it. At the upper end of the aqueduct will be
two main power-houses capable of developing 145,000 mechanical
horse-power twenty-four hours each day of the year.</p>

<p>The present plans of the city provide for its water needs
as far ahead as the year 2,000, when at the present rate of
growth there will be over 3,000,000 people around the Bay,
causing a necessity for 540,000,000 gallons of water daily.</p>

<p>(2) Before the House Committee in Washington, June,
1913, Colonel Biddle testified that he had made a personal examination
of every available source of water for the city and in detail
described the features of each source, its advantages and disadvantages.
Each one was considered not merely as to benefits to
San Francisco, but as to whether or not the taking of water would
be harmful to other sections now using it for other than domestic
purposes, especially for irrigation.</p>

<p>The testimony of Colonel Biddle was that all the water of
California was needed for domestic use and irrigation; that as
the State is settled more and more, and as better and better
facilities are devised for irrigation, more and more the streams
are becoming used for these purposes; and that the only available
sources of water for San Francisco would reach either the
Sacramento or San Joaquin rivers, both flowing into San Francisco
Bay, one from the north and one from the south, and together
forming a valley about 500 miles long.</p>

<p>The chairman of this committee, Scott Ferris, conducted
the examination as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With the information before you, coupled with the results
of these two investigations, if you were a member of this committee,
having due regard for the rights of the irrigation people,
those of the nature lovers, who believe that you should not interfere
with the Yosemite National Park, and the needs of San
Francisco, which system would you vote for?”</p>

<p>“Biddle—I would vote for the Hetch-Hetchy system.”</p>

<p>“Chairman—Would you feel, in casting a vote of that kind,
that you had inflicted a greater wrong upon the irrigation people
and the nature lovers than if you had voted for one of the other
systems?”</p>

<p>“Biddle—No, sir.”</p>
</div>

<p>The other two members of the Board of Engineers gave this
testimony:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Colonel Cosby—I concur fully with the statement of Colonel
Biddle. There is not the slightest question in my mind but
that this should be used as the source of water supply, and not
only that, but that it will be used as a water supply in a very
short time independently of whether this project is adopted or
not. I think the pressure will be so great to conserve the water
up there that it will be used as a storage reservoir. It is by far
the best storage reservoir in that section of the country, and
water is so valuable there that they cannot afford to let it run
to waste. If you deny the use of it to San Francisco, sooner or
later the water will be put to other uses. Somebody will be asking
for permission to utilize the Hetch-Hetchy Valley as a storage
reservoir for irrigation purposes.”</p>

<p>“Chairman—What do you think of the equitable distribution
made of it under the terms of this bill?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Taylor—I do not think the irrigation people have
anything to complain of in this bill.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1913 the official report of this Board of Army Engineers
is stated:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Board believes that on account of the fertility of the
lands under irrigation and their aridness without water the
necessity of preserving all available water in the valleys of California
will sooner or later make the demand for the use of
Hetch-Hetchy as a reservoir practically irresistible.”</p>
</div>

<p>The testimony of the members of the Board obtained great
weight because of their unquestioned technical skill and experience
and their positions, entirely disconnected from local
prejudice and interest.</p>

<p>That the Raker Bill will prove of considerable advantage
to nearly all, if not to all, other interests of the State of California
outside the Bay section affected by the Bill seems to have
been clearly established.</p>

<h3>IV. What will be the operative effects of the Raker Bill on the
Yosemite National Park?</h3>

<p>The total area flooded in the National Park will be 3373
acres. Of these the city owns about 1300 acres. The Government
under the Raker Bill will get, by exchange, the difference between
1300 acres and 3142.78 acres, which is 1842.78. The city
will take from the Government the difference between 1300
acres and 3373 acres, which is 2072. Hence, the city will trade
to the Government as much land as it takes for flooding, lacking
129.22 acres. The forests to be covered by the flooding are in
no part of the large redwoods, but are of a size frequently found
in a California forest.</p>

</div>

<p>The Chairman of the House Committee before mentioned,
finally conducted this examination:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Chairman—Don’t you think, as a matter of fact, that the
roads, trails, telephones, etc., that would come with this water
supply development would enhance the usefulness of the park
from the standpoint of poor people who cannot now go there?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Biddle—Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Chairman—As matters now stand, it would be pretty extravagant
for poor people to undertake to go there.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Biddle—It is impossible for them, unless they go
in with knapsacks on their backs.”</p>

<p>“Chairman—Poor people do not visit it at all, do they?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Biddle—I would not say that, because it is one of
the great delights of Californians, even if they are not well off,
to take knapsacks on their backs and go to the Sierras; but they
do not really stay long in the Hetch-Hetchy Valley. In the
early summer the mosquitoes are bad, in the late summer it
is too hot.”</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Cosby of the Board of Engineers gave this testimony:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Taylor of Colorado—Do you think these roads, provided for
in this bill, will make it accessible to a greater number of people?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Cosby—I do. At present I think there are practically
only two classes of people who use it, people who are
unusually wealthy or people who are unusually strong and healthy
and are able to make the trip.”</p>
</div>

<p>Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and Pueblo, Col., go into national
parks for their water supplies. Los Angeles goes into a government
forest reserve and brings its water from Inyo County, 220
miles, by aqueduct and more than twenty miles by tunnels.</p>

<p>Gifford Pinchot, testifying before this Committee, stated:
“As we all know, there is no use of water higher than the
domestic use. Now the fundamental principle of the whole conservative
policy is that of use, to take every part of the land and
its resources and put it to that use in which it will best serve the
most people.”</p>

<p>George Otis Smith, director of the Geological Survey,
stated: “I think we will agree that municipal use is the highest
value, next irrigation and lastly power—the generation of hydro-electric
energy. I believe the highest possible utilization of the
Tuolumne, or of any river, is that which provides, as far as
possible for a combination of these three values and the harmonizing
of the different uses.”</p>

<h3>V. From the foregoing and from all the evidence and conditions
developed under this design, some conclusions are manifest.</h3>

<p>The Bay section is the largest urban section in California
and is doing more business than any other. Its growth is
rapid. San Francisco is coming into control of all her municipal
utilities. The four great cities on the Bay are one in interest.
They will before long probably be one in municipal
government. This water power will be of tremendous commercial
advantage to these cities. To desire to obtain this water power,
is not sordid commercialism or base greed on the part of this
section. It is an endeavor to make use of the beneficial forces of
nature. It is evidence of a high state of advanced civilization.
It is a manifestation of enlightened government. It is fitting
and highly proper. It is a cause for praise to this city and the
lesser municipalities, not for recrimination and abuse.</p>

<p>That the lake in Hetch-Hetchy will not add to the attractiveness
of the beautiful valley is undetermined. Opinions
are divided. The lake and its accessories will be the means of
bringing thousands to a spot hitherto secluded, isolated and, to
many, inaccessible. The highest beneficial use of nature to civilization
is conservation. Were nature allowed to rest, grand and
gloomy, the tall forests and virgin prairie still would lie between
Plymouth Rock and the Golden Gate. The march of civilization
may still go on and adopt unto itself the high forces of nature
in an age of mighty progress and development, and still usually
leave “for him who, in the love of nature, holds communion with
her visible forms,” the tall cliff, the high waterfall, the grassy
flower-strewn valley, and here and there the virgin forest.</p>

<p>It is easy for the sensitive, the fanciful, and the one of
moods and tenses to make themselves believe that an infringement
upon what they regard as proper is an outrage upon decency,
and an indication that the sordid and mercenary are prevailing,
and that unless all of the good and true shall rally to the
defense the last bulwarks of decency will be stormed and
the citadel of high purpose, noble resolve and immaculate life
will be forever lost to a ruthless commercialized greed. The
forces of darkness and of distortion are not in overwhelming
numbers marching down the pike.</p>

<p>This bill is not an indication that the grisly hand of avarice
and the cold hand of ambition are seizing hold of the sacred and
inviolate. San Francisco may obtain this water, as good as any
in the world, and sufficient for her thousands to come for the
next 100 years. She may thereby obtain such water power as
during the same time will cause all the wheels of industry on
her great Bay to whirl and to whirr. Yet the Yosemite National
Park in the entire and Hetch-Hetchy in particular will remain,
visited by more than ever before, a thing of beauty and a joy
unto the ages yet to be.—<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Jan. 18, 1914.</p>
